-- A version of "Control.Concurrent.STM.TChan" where the queue is
-- bounded in length and closeable. This combines the abilities of
-- "Control.Concurrent.STM.TBChan" and "Control.Concurrent.STM.TMChan".
-- This variant incorporates ideas from Thomas M. DuBuisson's
-- @bounded-tchan@ package in order to reduce contention between
-- readers and writers.
